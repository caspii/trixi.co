    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>Trixi is ideal for small one-off events that you're organising with people you trust and like. </p>
    <p>This app is inspired by the likes of <a href="https://kittysplit.com">Kittysplit</a>
        or <a href="https://doodle.com">Doodle</a> which do not require you to register to do useful work (disclaimer: we actually made Kittysplit ðŸ˜‹)</p>
    <p>There are already a huge number of todo-list apps, project management tools, etc. so why make another?
        Trixi is based on the assumption that simplicity wins. It has done away with all unnecessary features and
        what remains is only what we consider to be essential.
        If you think something essential is missing, please <a href="mailto:caspar.wrede@gmail.com">get in touch</a>!
    </p>
    <p>The easiest way to find out more it to give it a spin!</p>
