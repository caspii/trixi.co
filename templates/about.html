        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>This app is inspired by the likes of <a href="https://kittysplit.com">Kittysplit</a>
            or <a href="https://doodle.com">Doodle</a> which do not require you to register to do useful work (disclaimer: we actually made Kittysplit ðŸ˜‹)</p>
        <p>There are already a huge number of todo-lists, project management tools, and so on, so why make another?
            Trixi is based on the assumption that simplicity wins. It has done away with all unnecessary features and
            left behind what we consider to be essential. If you think something essential is missing, please <a href="mailto:caspar.wrede@gmail.com">get in touch</a>!
        </p>
        <p>Trixi is ideal for small one-off events that you're organising with people you trust and like. </p>
        <p>The easiest way to find out more it to give it a spin!</p>
